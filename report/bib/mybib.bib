  abstract   = {Following the success of Virtuoso at last year’s Mighty Storage Challenge - MOCHA 2017, we decided to participate once again and test the latest Virtuoso version against the new tasks which comprise the MOCHA 2018 challenge. The aim of the challenge is to test the performance of solutions for SPARQL processing in aspects relevant for modern applications: ingesting data, answering queries on large datasets and serving as backend for applications driven by Linked Data. The challenge tests the systems against data derived from real applications and with realistic loads, with an emphasis on dealing with changing data in the form of streams or updates. Virtuoso, by OpenLink Software, is a modern enterprise-grade solution for data access, integration, and relational database management, which provides a scalable RDF Quad Store. In this paper, we present the final challenge results from MOCHA 2018 for Virtuoso v8.0, compared to the other participating systems. Based on these results, Virtuoso v8.0 was declared as the overall winner of MOCHA 2018.},
