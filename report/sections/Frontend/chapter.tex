\chapter{Communication Between Layers} \label{chap:Frontend}
One of the primary goals of this application is to give the lecturer a way to specify what constitutes a correct problem solution. In this chapter, we describe how actions performed on the user interface propagate events throughout the various components.

\section{Authentication and Roles}
When a user initially loads the website, they will not be signed in, and will only have minimal privileges.
This means that they will not have access to any of the course material or exercises.
In order to access any of these features, the user has to sign in.
By pressing the sign in button, the user is redirected to a sign in page that is specific to the authentication provider used.
In our case, it is Google.
After logging in with the authentication provider, the user is redirected back to the website.
At this point, the user is now logged in and the database will be updated with the user's information, as well as a token to keep track of the user's session.
This token is used by NextAuth to create a session for the user, which will be used to authenticate the user for subsequent requests to the site.
The session also has a role associated with it, which determines what actions the user is allowed to take on the site.
Figure \ref{fig:Home page} shows the landing page after the user has signed in. As can be seen, the \texttt{Courses} and \texttt{Dashboard} buttons on the navigation bar is available.

\end{figure}

\section{Syllabi, Problem Sets, and Exercises}
On the website, each page that displays course data makes a request to a Next backend API endpoint to retrieve the data from the database.
This request is made using tRPC, which allows for efficient communication between the frontend component and the backend component. tRPC wraps around React Query, which provides useful features such as caching and automatic refetching.
The request input is validated to ensure that it is in the correct format.
The user's authorization is also checked to ensure that they are allowed to access the data they have requested.
Once the input has been validated, the database is queried by the backend using Prisma to retrieve the requested data.

The actions that a user is allowed to take on a page depend on their role. For example, a lecturer may have the ability to create, edit, and delete syllabi, problem sets, and exercises, whereas a student may only be able to view the information on the page.
Figure \ref{fig:problemsets_teacher_view} and \ref{fig:exercise_overview} shows exercises as seen from a lecturer's and a students perspective respectively.

There is a modal on the page that contains form controls for creating new elements, such as syllabi or problem sets.
This modal helps to prevent invalid input by ensuring that the user enters the correct information before creating a new element.
Overall, our website supports create, read, update, and delete actions for lecturers and read-only access for students.

\section{Problem View and Code Editor}
When a user visits an exercise page, we fetch the code template before rendering the web page to prevent flashing it in after the page has loaded.
This is important because, without this, users with slow internet connections might see the template being overwritten after they have already started writing in it --- that is, if you don't disable the input field entirely until the page has finished loading data. Both these approaches could lead to confusion and frustration for the user, so we decided to fetch the template before the page is rendered.

Once the user interface for the page is rendered on the client, we fetch the problem, test, and previous submissions for the user.
This allows them to see the exercise definition and any previous submissions.
The code editor on the page uses CodeMirror with extensions to support multiple programming languages.
Currently, only the Haskell language extension is used.
We have developed a custom extension to propagate state to the parent component, which allows us to retrieve the code from the editor and send it to the backend.
In addition to allowing users to submit their solution, we also fetch their previous submissions from the backend.
This allows users to revisit their previous submissions and see the date they were submitted, as well as whether they solved the exercise.
This can be useful for users who want to track their progress or review their previous work.
