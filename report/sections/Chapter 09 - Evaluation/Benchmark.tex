\section{Benchmark evaluation}
To evaluate stress test and benchmark results of the developed Test Runner component, we must first establish a baseline which we can compare the component to. 
To establish such baseline, we have stress tested and benchmarked a version of the Test Runner utilize the Rocket create but does not implement the Queue System. 
\todo{insert figure showing the baseline stats}
\todo{describe the baseline stats}

The benchmark for the baseline utilize the same parameterization as the benchmark for the queue system, but does not rely on polling the result after processing.


\subsection{Results}
% What do we expect ---- that baseline is faster until reaching a certain number of request. Therefore, adjusting the
