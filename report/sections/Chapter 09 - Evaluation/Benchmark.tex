\section{Benchmark evaluation}
To evaluate stress test and benchmark results of the developed Test Runner component, we first establish a baseline which we can compare the component to. 
To establish such baseline, we have stress tested and benchmarked a version of the Test Runner utilize the Rocket create but does not implement the Queue System. 
We examine whether these 

\todo{establish baseline when we have the results ready}

The benchmark for the baseline utilize the same parameterization as the benchmark for the queue system, but does not rely on polling the result after processing. 
We suspect that when the Test Runner experience stress in the form of large number code submissions, a single threaded approach to handling the request ,will experience a form of cpu starvation where all responses will take a long time to complete.

% What do we expect ---- that baseline is faster until reaching a certain number of request. Therefore, adjusting the
