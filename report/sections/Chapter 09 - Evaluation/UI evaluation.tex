\section{UI evaluation}
To evaluate the User interface of our system, a usability test was conducted using participants that matches our target users. From this test we wanted to determine if our system provides a good user experience, and whether the users feel it is an improvement of the current system.
To do this we use the SUS questions as a basis for our questionnaire, with an added question on whether or not the users deem the system to be an improvement.

The participants of the usability test are students on the first semester of their software masters degree who are currently taking the haskell course. 
These students should have a good understanding of how to use Haskell to solve simple exercises. Based on this, we expect them to be able to successfully use our system. They also have experience with how the course is currently run, and can therefore give feedback on whether it is an improvement.

The usability test will be conducted in a group room with other students present but not interacting with the participant, this would simulate a class setting. 
The equipment used will be the participants own laptop, which simulates use in a real world setting.

\subsection*{Tasks}
To conduct the usability test, we have created a series of tasks that the participants should complete, in order to experience all features of the system.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find exercise 1 for this semester.
    \item Submit a program that should not solve the exercise.
    \item Submit a program that solves the exercise.
    \item Go back dashboard.
    \item Check which exercises has been completed by you.
\end{enumerate}
