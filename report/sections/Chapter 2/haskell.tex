\section{Haskell}
The Haskell programming language is purely functional\cite{} and builds upon the lambda calculus model of computation \cite{}.
Unlike many other programming languages, Haskell can both be interpreted or compiled into an executable binary file.
It is a statically typed language implementing many mathematical constructs such as currying, set-builder notation, recursive definitions of both types and functions, and more.
This allows the programmer to create concise solutions that would normally be quite verbose in other programming paradigms.  
Furthermore, solutions can be expressed in a more traditional, mathematical notation.
Haskell also implements more common programming language features such as polymorphism, type inference, and pattern matching.

Expressing many of these concepts in a functional paradigm is difficult for students used to traditional imperative and object oriented programming.


In practice, Haskell is used ...  

% It features many aspects needed for modern software development including built-in HTTP.
