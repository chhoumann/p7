\chapter{The Application}
To achieve the goal presented in section ..., we need to build a scalable program architecture.
To this end, we sketched our idea for the program architecture in the diagram shown in figure \ref{fig:...}.

The primary responsibility of the application is to act as a hub for a professor to create a syllabus related to specific programming courses.
The professor must be able to create exercises and specify the expected output required to solve the given exercise.

Students can then enroll in the courses created by the professor, giving them access to the syllabus.
Once enrolled, students are able to view and attempt to solve the exercises contained within the syllabus.

The goal is then to give the professor an overview of how well each student performed.
This is facilitated through a board, accessible only to the professor, which shows which exercises were solved, which exercises were not solved, and different statistics such as how much time was spent on each exercise.
