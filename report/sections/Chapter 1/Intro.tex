\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}
On the 1st semester of the Software Masterâ€™s Degree at \aau{}, the Programming Paradigms course had a problem; most attending students failed the course last year. 
This resulted in a survey being sent out, and a student task force being assembled to understand the issues that caused the high failure rate.
Here, many students mentioned not feeling experienced enough with the programming languages used in the course to teach the functional and logical programming paradigms.


Consequently, \aau{} chose to restructure the course entirely. 
Rather than teaching many different programming languages within the functional and logical programming paradigms, the course was restructured to focus on functional programming in Haskell.
Furthermore, the course now features more practical programming exercises with classroom discussion in-between, rather than traditional lectures followed by a separate exercise session.
Supporting this way of teaching, the course lectures have been moved to a more classical classroom setup.
By using a shared monitor at each table, multiple students can work together in groups to solve given problem sets.
In addition, a primary monitor at the lecture desk enables the professor to view and share other groups' monitors such that student solutions can be used for classroom discussions.
