\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}
On the 1st semester of the Software Masterâ€™s Degree at \aau{} the programming paradigms course currently has a problem where most of the attending students failed the course last time it was held. This led to a large survey being sent out and a student task force being assembled to grasp the main flaws with how the course was structured. Here a large part of the students mentioned a lack of expertise in the programming languages taught in the course and a lack of possibilities for actively training their skills during the semester. 


With this knowledge in mind, \aau{} chose to restructure the course with a larger focus on practical programming as opposed to the more classic lectures that are usually used at universities. To support this way of teaching, the course lectures have been moved to a more classical classroom setup but with a monitor at each table and a main monitor at the lecture desk. This is meant to allow the students to more easily work together in groups while working on the shared monitor and allowing the lectures to view and share the groups monitors allowing actual implementations by the students to be used for classroom discussions. 


This way of solving the problem brings its problems with it, however. As all students are using their own local environments for solving the exercises at hand, other students cannot revisit the exercise solutions discussed as these are not shared, making it hard to revisit them later. Furthermore, it can be hard to remember concrete implementations as well as verify whether your own implementation is correct and lives up to the requirements of the exercise. In fact, it is not uncommon for people to accidentally misunderstand an exercise and therefore implement the wrong solution.  

\section{Initial Problem} 
\aau's current restructuring of the course already seems like a major improvement over the former structure but as mentioned it still suffers from a few notable problems.
\begin{itemize}
	\item No way to revisit discussed solutions
	\item No way to verify that an implementation is correct
	\item No way for the entire group to work together on the same code
	\item No way for the professor to verify how far the students are in the problem solving
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hard to verify that all students have solved the problems
		\item Hard to judge the skill-level of the students and if the exercises are suitable
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To try and solve these problems we would like to develop a website targeted toward the professor that enables him to gain a better overview during exercise sessions and therefore allows him to improve the quality of the sessions. To facilitate this, we imagine a website that should allow the professor to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The professor should be able to create a syllabus with the exercises that students are expected to solve
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The professor should be able to create multiple syllabi where students can self-enrol into the relevant ones for them
	\end{itemize}
	\item The professor should be able to track the amount of exercises completed by each enrolled student
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The professor should be able to view additional stats such as attempts used 
	\end{itemize}
	\item The professor should be able to specify criteria in order to pass each exercise 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The students should be able to verify is their solution lives up to the specified criteria
		\item Criteria checking should be handled automatically by the system
	\end{itemize}
	\item The students should be able to collaborate on the same code
	\item The students should have access to the discussed solutions later on
	\item The professor should be able to see each students code
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MVP}
The presented features were then prioritized by a group of students to construct a minimal viable product (MVP) that could be tested and used to verify if the presented product would provide anything useful to the course. Since the MVP is meant to be used as a demo product that allows for additional input to be gathered only the minimum number of functionalities needed were included.

\begin{displayquote}
A website that allows a user to specify a set of exercises as well as the completion criteria for each of these exercises. Furthermore an option to verify whether the submitted code is a correct solution to the chosen exercise.
